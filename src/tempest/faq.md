# FAQ / Common Issues

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions.

## How do I get in game once I launched?
Make sure `Enable Console` is checked in the launcher settings, at the login screen type anything into the user and pass and click login. Once it says `Logging in`, press `F1` on your keyboard.

## I can't install any version, the download arrow button does nothing
Make sure you've selected a `Build Directory`, this will define where the builds are downloaded

## How do I participate in a playtest?
1. First of all you need to have `OB 57` downloaded<br>
2. Then you'll need to download a program called `RAdmin VPN` and join the network, to do that once you installed it, open it and go into `Network -> Join Network`
> The Network name is `paladinskana` and the Password is `kana123`
3. Then on Tempest settings, make sure `Enable Console` is checked and load the multiplayer mod (the upk file) that you've downloaded using the + icon next to Mod Loader
4. Then, in the launch options at the top of the setting, enter the ip address of the host followed by the parameters for your name and champion
> Example Launch Args: 26.203.83.83?name=Cinnamon?class=shalin

## Can you balance the game, like change champions damage, health etc?
Short answer: No<br>
Long answer: Yes, but it requires going through the [assembly](/marshal/files/assembly) file to make changes about a specific value for a specific champion which is tedious to do and not a priority, then everyone needs to have the same [assembly](/marshal/files/assembly) file
